# Yarn search indexer status page

https://yarn-search-status.netlify.com

This is a small dashboard (and graphql endpoint) for seeing the status of the [npm -> Algolia indexer](https://github.com/algolia/npm-search).

## Setting this up yourself

- If you want this to be deployed: use Netlify
- set the env variables in a file `.env` copied from `.env.example`
